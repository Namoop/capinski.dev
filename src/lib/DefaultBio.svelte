	Hi, I'm a UC Berkeley student studying math, physics, and history.
	I'm also a web developer, and I like to make games and tools in my free time.
	I started programming as a wee lad on Scratch, and I've been hooked ever since.
	<br><br>&emsp;
	Other than websites, I've worked with C++, Java/Kotlin, and Python, but
	<a href="https://svelte.dev" class="link">Svelte</a>
	is always the easiest to get ideas up and running
	quickly&mdash;for my attention span smaller than a lobotomized goldfish's, that's a big plus.
	I'm currently working on polishing some of my older stuff
	and/or figuring out how rust works.
	I'm always looking for new projects to
	<span class="line-through">procrastinate quantum mechanics problem sets</span>
	explore.
	<br><br>&emsp;
	Questions?
	<span class="italic">why?</span>
	Regardless, I can be reached at the social icons below!
	Response time is between now and the end of the universe.
